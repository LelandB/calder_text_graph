# calder_text_graph
All .js files run from the textgraph.html
The filters distort the text SVG layer or the entire force graph SVG layer. The textgraph.js initially distorts only the text layer, can be modified (by uncommenting line 156 and commenting line 153). The distortgraph.js overlays the graph over the Reservoir Dogs. Dragging the map around, you can see the outline of the people and their suits.
